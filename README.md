# P-Adic-Norm-NN
The P-Adic number system is an extension of the Rationals in a totally different way than the Reals 

The P-Adic Norm like any norm defines a sort of distance - it is a metric just like the Euclidean Norm

It takes two numbers and returns a property which is something like how far they are. 

In the Euclidean paradise which we live in it is often an intuitive short cut to believe that 3-dimensional distance is somehow the final ontological distance between what ever objects. Sadly this couldn’t be further from the truth. 

In fact the Euclidean distance lets us down right off the bat when we talk about images! 
 A photograph is a 2-dimensional representation of a three dimensional object and therefore does not preserve the proper distance between any two points. We need to use our constructed understanding of reality, a posteriori, in order to fill in the gaps. 

“But, guy, look this simply owing to the dimensional reduction!” 

First off, I am not your guy, pal, but secondly yes - you are right - it is however right only in the special case where the object in question is either at maximum or minimum entropy. That is, “effectively homogenous” as soon as objects develop dynamic properties or heterogenous structures, as soon as we sunder that symmetry of organization, we dive headlong into a N-dimensional Hilbert Space or a Phase Space or whatever.

I like to think of the naive distance (euclidean distance) as the first order expansion of an objects true distance. 
With out even stepping into the apocryphal we can be safe in this assumption by simply mentioning that the concept of spatial interval is dependent on a frame of reference. Special Relativity would be a second order term. 

Anyway more later.

# The P-Adic Norm is Small when the difference of two numbers is divisible by a big-ass power of P.  

# Example
|2050-2| is closer to each other than |4-2|
